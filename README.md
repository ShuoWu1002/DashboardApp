This project was developing a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3.js to track satellites in real-time based on observer geo-location.
Built observer latitude, longitude, altitude, radius and duration based selector to specify  satellite search parameters.
Fetched world land data using axios and drew a world map on canvas generated by d3-selection.
Animated selected satellite trajectories on the world map using D3.js.
Deployed the dashboard to AWS.
